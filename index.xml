      <description>Argentina v Chile Goals Messi 33&#39;
Vargas 57&#39;
An even match. Messi got underway with an amazing freekick past Bravo(Just Messi things) The equaliser was classic Argentina which was annoying. Vidal took a penalty which was tipped to the crossbar but Vargas scored on the rebound.
Paraguay v Bolivia Goals Saavedra(P) 10&#39;
Romero 62&#39;
Romero 65&#39;
Romero 80&#39;
Although Bolivia scored the first goal with a pen and went into half-time in the lead, the red card changed everything and immediately Paraguay attacked hard and scored 3 simple goals making the numerical advantage count.</description>

      <description>Brazil v Venezuela Goals Marquinhos 23&#39;
Neymar(P) 64&#39;
Gabriel Barbosa 89&#39;
A very dominant display from the new hosts. Should&amp;rsquo;ve been atleast 4 or 5 given the types of chances they got. Marquinhos scored the first one from the corner with a brilliant. Neymar then scored a pen and could&amp;rsquo;ve had a hattrick at the very least. Finally he assisted Gabigol after rounding the keeper.
Colombia v Ecuador Goals E.Cardona 42&amp;rsquo;</description>
